# 🐦 Avocet Framework

The Avocet Framework is a custom, freestanding 32-bit operating system kernel and high-fidelity desktop ecosystem that bridges low-level C architecture with an embedded Python user space. Inspired by the premium aesthetics of mainstream distributions like Ubuntu and Fedora, Avocet implements its own user-space shell, system utilities, and games. These run on top of a custom, lightweight graphical toolkit named `avocet`, drawing inspiration from both `tkinter` and `customtkinter`.

## 🚀 Key Architectural Features

- **Freestanding Kernel Core**: Implements a dedicated MBR bootloader, Global Descriptor Table (GDT), Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), 2-level paging Virtual Memory Manager (VMM), and a dynamic kernel heap allocator.
- **Embedded Python Subsystem**: Links low-level C hardware graphics, clock timers, and keyboard interrupt streams directly to a Python runtime environment using a native C extension bridge (`avocet_core`).
- **`avocet` UI Toolkit Clone**: A modular, object-oriented user interface framework that handles geometry mapping, alignment calculations, and standard desktop color palettes.
- **Dual-OS Backend Terminal**: A hybrid terminal console matching command syntaxes from both Linux (`ls`, `clear`, `cat`) and Windows (`dir`, `cls`, `type`).
- **Rich Utility Ecosystem**: Features a standalone text-based HTML browser, markdown text editors, process task managers, and bot-driven desktop leisure games.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Avocet uses an organized architecture that cleanly separates the OS foundation (kernel and shell) from the application layers (Python-based utilities and UI).

## 🛠️ Prerequisites & Installation

### 🍎 macOS Hosts

Compilation on macOS requires the **Homebrew** package manager. Download and install it from the [Homebrew Official Website](https://brew.sh). Once installed, open your terminal (Terminal or iTerm2) and execute the following commands to install the required GNU toolchain, 32-bit compilation dependencies, Python, NASM, and QEMU:

```bash
# Install dependencies
brew install \
  gcc \
  python3 \
  qemu \
  nasm \
  make

# (Optional for Apple Silicon Macs): Avocet is a 32-bit x86 OS, so you may require x86_64 architecture 
# emulation libraries if building locally on an M1/M2/M3 Mac
```

> **Note for macOS users**: Due to macOS Catalina and later dropping 32-bit environment support entirely, you must use a cross-compiler or a virtualized x86 environment to compile the freestanding 32-bit kernel properly.

### Windows Hosts

Compilation on Windows requires **MSYS2**. Download and install it from the [MSYS2 Official Website](https://msys2.org). Depending on your target architecture and preferred compiler toolchain, open the corresponding MSYS2 shell terminal and execute the matching package installation command (You can check more installation methods at DOCS.md.):

#### 🟩 UCRT64 (Recommended Default)
Modern Windows environment using the Universal C Runtime (UCRT) and GCC.

```bash
pacman "-S" --needed base-devel \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-qemu
```

> **Note for Windows users**: There are other ways to compile the framework on a Windows environment, such as using Chocolatey, but we prefer MSYS2 for its simplicity and versatility across different development versions.

### Linux Hosts

Select the command block that matches your Linux distribution to install the required GNU toolchain, 32-bit cross-compilers, Python development packages, and QEMU system emulators. You can check more installation methods at DOCS.md.

#### 📦 Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install "-y" \
  build-essential \
  gcc-multilib \
  g++-multilib \
  python3-dev \
  qemu-system-x86 \
  nasm
```

> **Note on 32-bit compilation:** Because Avocet is a freestanding 32-bit kernel, Linux hosts require 32-bit development libraries (e.g., `multilib-devel` or `gcc-multilib`) to successfully resolve 32-bit compilation flags like `-m32` if you choose to build locally instead of using a cross-compiler toolchain.

## 💻 Building and Running

Avocet employs a decentralized build system with a primary `Makefile` centralized at the root. Run compilation targets directly from your workspace root:

```bash
# Build the entire framework and boot the OS in QEMU
make run

# Build only the desktop environment
make desktop

# Remove compiled binaries and artifacts
make clean
```
